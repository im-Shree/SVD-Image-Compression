### SVD-Image-Compression
  
  We will perform image compression using single value decomposition on raw image data.
  Then we convert it into grayscale by averaging the R,G,B val ues for each pixel.

 We converts the original image to grayscale by taking the mean of the RGB channels. 
  Display the grayscale image, and provides information about the shape of the resulting array.
  
  Perform SVD on a matrix X, calculates the variance explained by each singular value, 
  Visualize the top 20 singular values' variance explained using a bar plot.
